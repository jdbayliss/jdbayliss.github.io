## Data-Oriented Design: a Paradigm

What is data-oriented development? It’s a paradigm for solving problems with computing that highlights the nature of data and how it flows through a computer. Having watched this paradigm developing over the years from the talks given by Mike Acton to information on blogs, designing software in a data-oriented way involves the following features:

1. Know the problem you’re trying to solve
2. **Know the data and how it flows through your system**
3. **Know the hardware**
4. **Know the tools (like language and compiler)**
5. Validate that you actually do know the above

If you don’t know something, ask somebody, read the specs, watch a video/stream, experiment, or otherwise figure out what you don’t know

The highlighted numbers tend to be the features of data-oriented design that separate it from other design paradigms such as object-oriented design. Engineering software for an explicit hardware range is not normally considered in software paradigms, but greatly impacts how the data flows through the system. Thus, in data-orientation it’s an important consideration. The same can be said for knowledge of the tools for writing software such as compilers and languages.

There are many arguments for learning how to develop in a data-oriented way. The best arguments I’ve heard would be the following:

1. All a computer does is data input, data transformations, and output. Why shouldn’t our programs reflect the way that the machine works?
2. Data-oriented design leads to more energy efficient, faster code
3. The emphasis on data tends to lead to better data parallel code solutions for multi-core machines.

Some of those words above are fighting words, but I’m not going to argue with folks over what paradigm is the best paradigm for a project. I only want to put out there that data-oriented design is an actual paradigm separate from object-oriented, functional, and procedural design. It’s worth discussing, learning, and studying for itself just so that it can be useful to a broader range of software developers outside of game development where the paradigm is heavily used.

The main problem many people have when trying to switch to a more data-oriented way of developing is that the paradigm itself requires a lot of background knowledge about hardware and how computers work that engineers may not have learned in school. 

It’s my goal to help folks interested in learning some of that background.
